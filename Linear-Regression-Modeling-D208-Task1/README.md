# 📈 Performance Assessment: Linear Regression Modeling

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project involves the analysis and modeling of healthcare income data using **Multiple Linear Regression** in Python. The goal is to uncover the relationship between income levels and health conditions, providing insights that can help optimize healthcare policies and resource allocation. The project includes:  
✅ A cleaned and prepared dataset 📊  
✅ Detailed regression modeling using Python 🐍  
✅ Actionable insights for healthcare decision-making 📈
