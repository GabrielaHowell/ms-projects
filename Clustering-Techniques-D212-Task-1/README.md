# 🏥 Patient Clustering Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses **K-means clustering** to analyze patient data and identify patterns related to **Age**, **Income**, **VitD_levels**, and **TotalCharge**. The goal is to help healthcare organizations improve care strategies and reduce readmissions.

## 🎯 Key Findings  
🔍 **Clusters** identified based on patient data:  
- **Cluster 0**: Younger patients with lower charges  
- **Cluster 1**: Younger patients with higher charges  
- **Cluster 2**: Older patients with lower charges  
- **Cluster 3**: Older patients with higher charges  

📈 These insights can assist healthcare organizations in tailoring care plans for different patient groups.

🚀 Happy Analyzing! 😃
