## ⚙️ Setup Instructions  

### 🛠️ Data Preparation  
1️⃣ Run the provided **Python Notebook** to clean and prepare the dataset, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and converting categorical variables via one-hot encoding.  
2️⃣ Ensure the cleaned dataset (`D209_part2_clean.csv`) and the training/testing splits are generated successfully.

### 🔍 Predictive Modeling  
1️⃣ Load the training and testing data files (`X_train_task2.csv`, `X_test_task2.csv`, `Y_train_task2.csv`, `Y_test_task2.csv`) in your Python environment.  
2️⃣ Follow the Notebook to perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV for the AdaBoosted Decision Tree model.  
3️⃣ Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, ROC AUC, confusion matrix, and classification report.
