# 🩺 Performance Assessment: Logistic Regression Modeling

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project involves analyzing a medical dataset using **Logistic Regression** in Python to identify the factors that contribute to the likelihood of patient readmission. The primary research question is:  
> **Which factors contribute to the likelihood of patient readmission?**

The analysis aims to uncover significant predictors and provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals. The project includes:  
✅ A cleaned and prepared dataset 📊  
✅ Detailed logistic regression modeling using Python 🐍  
✅ Insights to help reduce readmission rates and improve patient care 📈
