# Anxiety Classification: KNN in Action 🤖

Welcome to the **Anxiety Classification** project! This initiative leverages **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to predict anxiety diagnoses based on a variety of health-related features. The aim is to identify key factors that can help healthcare providers better understand and predict anxiety in patients. 🧠

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to classify anxiety diagnoses based on health-related data. The project includes:  
✅ A dataset with health metrics 🧑‍⚕️  
✅ KNN classification model implementation 🤖  
✅ Evaluation metrics (accuracy, AUC) 📊
