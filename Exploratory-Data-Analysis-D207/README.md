# 🚀 Market Basket Analysis for Hospital Data

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze prescription data using **Market Basket Analysis** techniques, such as **Association Rule Mining** and the **Apriori Algorithm**, to identify key associations that can drive strategic decisions. The goal is to enhance patient care, reduce readmissions, and improve diabetes management within the hospital system. The project includes:  
✅ Data preprocessing for medical prescriptions and hospital services 📊  
✅ Market Basket Analysis to uncover frequent patterns 🛒  
✅ Insights visualized through interactive **Tableau** dashboards 📈
